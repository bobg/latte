Latte was created by Bob Glickstein <http://www.zanshin.com/~bobg> and
is dedicated to the amazing and wonderful Suzanne Glickstein.

Latte is a simple language for marking up text in a very expressive
way.  This distribution includes the Latte library, which allows you
to build translators from Latte to any other text format you choose,
and a demonstration application that converts Latte text into HTML,
allowing you to write web pages in a much saner language than HTML.

Complete documentation is available in Texinfo and Info formats in the
Latte distribution.  An HTML version of the documentation is available
on the Latte website at <http://www.latte.org/>.

Several aspects of HTML are annoying to write.  Using <p> tags in
every paragraph, for example, when it ought to suffice simply to leave
a blank line between paragraphs.  Having to match every <foo> with a
</foo>, when other languages allow blocks to be delimited by simple
matching typographical characters like { and }.  (Plus, text editors
have a hard time helping you keep constructs like <foo> and </foo>
correctly balanced.)  Having to use special magic to include the
characters <, >, &, and ", which are all too common in text documents.
Having no way to define higher-level macros or subroutines for
frequently used constructs.

Latte solves these by introducing a simpler syntax that also has a
facility for defining transformation functions.  Here are some
comparisons:

    HTML                                  LATTE

  <b><i>Bold-italic</i></b>             {\b {\i Bold-italic}}

  <b><i>Bold-italic</b></i> (ERROR!)    (Latte not prone to this error.)

  <ul>                                  {\ul {\li First item}
   <li>First item                            {\li Second item}}
   <li>Second item
  </ul>

  <table>                               {\def {\person \=name \=rank \=serial}
   <tr valign=top>                       {\tr \valign=top
    <td><b>Name</b></td>                  {\td {\b \name}}
    <td>Rank</td>                         {\td \rank}
    <td>Serial number</td>                {\td \serial}}}
   </tr>                                {\table
   <tr valign=top>                       {\person \name=Name
    <td><b>Second name</b></td>                   \rank=Rank
    <td>Second rank</td>                          \serial={Serial number}}
    <td>Second serial number</td>        {\person \name={Second name}
   </tr>                                          \rank={Second rank}
  </table>                                        \serial={Second serial
                                                           number}}}

  &quot;Penn &amp; Teller&quot;         "Penn & Teller"

  <p>                                   Not needed; just separate
					paragraphs with blank lines
					like you normally would.

Any resemblance between the names Latte and LaTeX is purely
coincidental :-)
