*   Latte 2.1 released (25 October 1999)
**     Fix for gcc 2.95 compiler error
**     One more speedup -- swapped Latte definition of \while for compiled
**     New macros in standard.latte: \defmacro and \foreach

*   Latte 2.0 released (21 October 1999 -- happy birthday, Latte!)
**     Speed optimizations
**     Bug fixes
**     New parser (unfortunately, syntax error reporting is slightly degraded)
**     latte-text translator (rudimentary)
**     New string inequality operators
**     New operator \funcall
**     \varref operator removed
**     New latte-html option -p for including </p> at para ends.  Imperfect.
**     shdeque<> is a "shared deque" and is the basis for Latte_List
**     New error type, "Useless subexpression"
**     Bonus Perl script, html-latte.pl (converts HTML to Latte)
**     Current directory implicity searched for library files after LATTE_PATH
**     Macros, quote, and quasiquote
**     Eval rules greatly sanitized
***       Top-level forms evaluated top-down instead of inside out
***       "Visitors" no longer responsible for evaluating expressions
***       Redundant evals eliminated
***       Closure-value ambiguity eliminated
Closures return the value of their last subexpression.  Previously,
closures constructed a list of all subexpression values and returned
that, BUT unwrapped that list if it contained exactly one
subexpression, leading to confusion for callers.

*   Latte 1.1 released (10 November 1998)
**     Support for building RedHat-style RPM distributions
**     Support for MacOS and Win32
**     API documentation partially completed
**     No need to install flex to build Latte
**     Debugging output slightly improved
**     Flex-generated symbols are now renamed to avoid name clashes
**     New generic character-entity functions \ch and \chx
**     Command-line enhancements: -o FILE; and `-' means stdin
**     Error messages now give a useful backtrace

*   Latte 1.0.1 released (26 October 1998)
**     Now compiles on Solaris
...after working around some compiler bugs

**     Fix --enable-floating-point
**     Optimize some list accesses
**     \nth now understands a negative index like \substr and \subseq do
**     Some function arguments are more rigorously range-checked
**     Error reports now count function arguments from 1, not 0
**     Fix \while so it doesn't build a useless implicit list of values

*   Latte 1.0 released (21 October 1998)
